00:00.200 --> 00:05.100
- The next we're going to discuss IP address setting in a bit more detail into

00:04.200 --> 00:05.500
- Begin that discussion

00:05.300 --> 00:12.200
- We were going to talk a little more depth about what some of that content is included in the IP pocket headers

00:11.700 --> 00:20.700
- So where we're headed with the IP address thing is after we introduced a bit more detail in the iip had her information

00:20.600 --> 00:25.300
- classless entered interdomain routing Cedar as well as Network address translation

00:24.700 --> 00:29.800
- how addressing works at particularly a couple more sophisticated addressing mechanisms specifically

00:29.400 --> 00:37.400
- and then we're going to talk about for ipv4

00:35.500 --> 00:40.100
- When you talk about IP fragmentation

00:44.0 --> 00:48.200
- there's some Heather information and then there's also a payload

00:47.700 --> 00:48.800
- but it looks like this

00:48.500 --> 00:52.400
- So the IP packet header we've seen this before

00:52.0 --> 00:54.900
- as well as types of service

00:54.500 --> 00:57.800
- with the length of the header is

00:57.400 --> 00:58.200
- at cetera

00:57.800 --> 00:58.200
- sex

00:57.800 --> 01:00.200
- what's included in this Header

00:59.900 --> 01:05.300
- Information would include things like the version of Ip being used to sit before me

01:05.0 --> 01:05.300
- So

01:05.0 --> 01:08.100
- So what are some of those things mean

01:07.600 --> 01:15.400
- So the version number would be encoded with four bits and it would indicate what version of the IP protocols being used

01:15.200 --> 01:18.500
- So this would be necessary to know what other fields to expect

01:18.0 --> 01:19.700
- Cuz it could change

01:19.400 --> 01:21.0
- So typically it's still ipv4

01:20.900 --> 01:24.700
- But increasingly IPv6 going to talk about why things would move to IPv6

01:24.300 --> 01:26.800
- Eventually they had her

01:26.0 --> 01:30.200
- Length would include how many 32-bit words are in the header

01:30.100 --> 01:30.400
- ipv4 header

01:30.200 --> 01:33.200
- which should correspond to 20 byte

01:33.100 --> 01:34.900
- It would typically be 5

01:34.600 --> 01:36.200
- It could be

01:43.900 --> 01:52.400
- then is eight bits in the header and it would allow packets to be treated differently based on what needs are

01:52.200 --> 01:52.800
- the type of service

01:52.600 --> 01:55.0
- More when various IP options are used as though

01:54.800 --> 01:57.800
- along the way as well as for a destination node

01:57.400 --> 01:59.800
- that may be useful for routers to know

01:59.500 --> 02:02.400
- another type type of service criteria

02:02.300 --> 02:09.300
- maybe they're slow delay for audio high bandwidth for a bulk transfer

02:09.100 --> 02:09.500
- for example

02:09.300 --> 02:09.500
- So

02:09.300 --> 02:10.100
- That's receiving information

02:18.200 --> 02:31.400
- So if your other pieces have been the total length corresponding to how big the payload is some additional information for whether the tea packet has been fragmented

02:31.0 --> 02:33.400
- And we're going to talk in more depth about that shortly

02:33.0 --> 02:36.0
- or with the destination IP address is

02:35.600 --> 02:41.200
- some of the other critical information like what the source IP addresses that we talked about previously

02:40.800 --> 02:41.700
- of course

02:41.200 --> 02:41.800
- And then
