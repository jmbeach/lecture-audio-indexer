00:00.200 --> 00:05.100
The next we're going to discuss IP address setting in a bit more detail into

00:05.100 --> 00:06.200
Begin that discussion

00:06.200 --> 00:13.100
We were going to talk a little more depth about what some of that content is included in the IP pocket headers

00:13.100 --> 00:22.400
So where we're headed with the IP address thing is after we introduced a bit more detail in the iip had her information

00:22.400 --> 00:24.700
When you talk about IP fragmentation

00:24.700 --> 00:38.000
and then we're going to talk about for ipv4, how addressing works at particularly a couple more sophisticated addressing mechanisms specifically

00:38.000 --> 00:42.300
classless entered interdomain routing Cedar as well as Network address translation

00:44.000 --> 00:47.700
So the IP packet header we've seen this before

00:47.700 --> 00:48.800
but it looks like this

00:48.800 --> 00:53.500
there's some Heather information and then there's also a payload

00:53.500 --> 00:54.300
So

00:54.300 --> 00:55.600
what's included in this Header

00:55.600 --> 01:03.500
Information would include things like the version of Ip being used to sit before me

01:03.500 --> 01:03.900
sex

01:03.900 --> 01:04.400
at cetera

01:04.400 --> 01:05.700
with the length of the header is

01:05.700 --> 01:08.700
as well as types of service

01:08.700 --> 01:10.800
So what are some of those things mean

01:10.800 --> 01:18.500
So the version number would be encoded with four bits and it would indicate what version of the IP protocols being used

01:18.500 --> 01:22.400
So this would be necessary to know what other fields to expect

01:22.400 --> 01:23.200
Cuz it could change

01:23.200 --> 01:26.000
So typically it's still ipv4

01:26.000 --> 01:30.700
But increasingly IPv6 going to talk about why things would move to IPv6

01:30.700 --> 01:33.200
Eventually they had her

01:33.200 --> 01:37.500
Length would include how many 32-bit words are in the header

01:37.500 --> 01:41.300
It would typically be 5, which should correspond to 20 byte

01:41.300 --> 01:42.900
ipv4 header

01:42.900 --> 01:43.900
It could be

01:43.900 --> 01:47.400
More when various IP options are used as though

01:47.400 --> 01:49.500
the type of service

01:49.500 --> 01:55.500
then is eight bits in the header and it would allow packets to be treated differently based on what needs are

01:55.500 --> 01:55.900
So

01:55.900 --> 01:56.200
for example

01:56.200 --> 02:00.400
maybe they're slow delay for audio high bandwidth for a bulk transfer

02:00.400 --> 02:04.500
another type type of service criteria

02:04.500 --> 02:09.100
that may be useful for routers to know

02:09.100 --> 02:15.100
along the way as well as for a destination node

02:15.100 --> 02:16.100
That's receiving information

02:18.200 --> 02:31.400
So if your other pieces have been the total length corresponding to how big the payload is some additional information for whether the tea packet has been fragmented

02:31.400 --> 02:33.800
And we're going to talk in more depth about that shortly

02:33.800 --> 02:35.300
And then

02:35.300 --> 02:35.600
of course

02:35.600 --> 02:41.200
some of the other critical information like what the source IP addresses that we talked about previously

02:41.200 --> 02:43.600
or with the destination IP address is
