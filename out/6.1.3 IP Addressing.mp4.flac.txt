So we're going to continue our discussion of IP address swing by next discussing hierarchical addressing and seeing where we're headed with how IP addressing works over.
 So IP addresses, as we've seen examples of typically, I'm at least an ipv4. We use this dotted quad notation. We then use a prefix of the IP address for aggregation. We saw that in when we discuss forwarding with longest prefixes. And then, there are a few different ways that IP addresses can be grouped together either using classful address or using classless interdomain routing or Cedar addressing or not talk about these. There are also some special purpose address block. So some reserved addresses that you may be familiar with and then finally will get into a discussion of how Network address translation Works which alleviate some of the issues with having a finite supply of IP addresses.
 There's another problem that will discuss a little bit of which is how we assign IP addresses. How do we pick which address blocks to give out to her? How do we assign IP addresses to your particular organization? So, I'll talk a little bit about that. So just remind you in the IP packet, header. We have 32 bits for a source IP address in 32 bits for a destination IP address. So this is going to correspond to those. A quad notation, where we'll have four.
 8-bit numbers in each of those quads. So we'll see how that looks. So, there are two IP addresses there. The destination address, again needs to be unique, identifier locator for the receiving address in the source. Address needs to be unique, identifier or a locator for the sending host.
 So how should we associate IP addresses with things that we need to address? So, for example, a telephone number is not associated with a person but with a handset typically, what structure should we also impose on addresses and what implications for different types of structures like that lead to then who determines a particular address is used on the global internet since this is a shared resource. What implications are there of how that's done. So I can address some of these issues as we start to look into how IP addresses work and how they're built up. So, what's the IP address again in? Ipv4? This is a unique. 32-bit number what did identifies as an interface on a particular Hoster router. And this is because a given router might have multiple interfaces, likewise it given computer might have multiple network interface cards.
 The standard representation of this, in this dotted quad notation. Looks like this where each of these bites would correspond. Aa200 number between 0 and 255 read. So, for this number 1234, 15085. It would look something like this where the first bite corresponding to the 12 II by corresponds to the 34 and so on.
 So we do use hierarchical addressing and you're familiar with this already. We use this and postal mail. And this is how you should think of, how some of this is going to work for IP. For example, if you want to send something to me, how do you do that? Well, the most important part of this is the zip code that make sure it gets to the right, General? Regional location within the US. And then there's some further more detailed hierarchical information about where my building is actually located what street it's on. And what the building number is on that street and then a particular room number in that building them since multiple people my chair room. You probably also put my name on it so that it could actually get delivered to me soon. Forwarding the u.s. Mail out this way. They operate. It. Would the letter first or get delivered to the post office in the particular zip code, then we'd give it to the mail person covering the particular Street.
 And I dropped off the mail the letter in the mailbox for that building or Suite then maybe someone would further distribute that. So this is a hierarchical process going from that high-level getting it to the right post office on the right step code.
 Serta hierarchical addressing. We use a prefix to correspond to what network we're going to talk about and then shorter portion of the address to correspond to a particular host within the within that Network. So within this hierarchical addressing we break the address into two pieces, you can think of the left part, sort of like the zip code and then the right part would be sort of like the particular street address. Okay. So this sometimes is referred to as the slash notation. Like if I have a 24 prefix, which is what's designated with this example, or I'm using the first three bites to correspond to the prefix with eight bits allowed for the host. Then we might call the / 24, cuz we're using a 24-bit prefix.
 So what you would do to identify say the host, then you often work with the subnet mask, which could be 24 bits, and we could get rid of any of the information about the particular host. So if I took the conjunction of these two numbers in binary, I would zero out all these particular host Fitz. And then what this first part or prefix of the IP address would correspond to is the network that we need to send the information to. So this 1234. 158 would correspond to the network again think of this prefix sort of like a zip code and I would first need to get it to the appropriate Network as we're delivering this pocket or piece of information. And the particular router is along the way, it wouldn't really need to worry about what the particular host is. There were just need to get it to the appropriate Network. And then once it's on the appropriate Network, then the route.
 Words within that Network, could deliver it to the final in toast. So, this is how the hierarchical addressing roughly would work if we were using a fixed-length prefix, like 24, vets.
