00:00.100 --> 00:00.700
So next

00:00.700 --> 00:09.800
we're going to continue some discussion of scalability and how IP addresses get allocated as well as some other special-purpose IP addresses that we haven't yet discussed

00:11.200 --> 00:15.300
So has reportedly seen with prefixing

00:15.300 --> 00:18.300
Also noticed this address aggregation

00:18.300 --> 00:23.400
This is one mechanism through which will enable scalability

00:23.400 --> 00:23.900
So

00:23.900 --> 00:24.200
for example

00:24.200 --> 00:29.800
if a provider has given these two addresses starting 2:01

00:29.800 --> 00:33.300
10 corresponding to this range of addresses

00:33.300 --> 00:34.400
201

00:34.400 --> 00:35.900
10

00:35.900 --> 00:37.300
0, through

00:37.300 --> 00:38.600
7 than anything

00:38.600 --> 00:41.300
And that's based on this 21 mask

00:41.300 --> 00:42.800
So then

00:42.800 --> 00:49.800
the provider could assign these in any way they like and the routers and the rest of the internet would only need to know how to reach this provider

00:49.800 --> 00:54.500
They don't need to know any additional information about these individual customers

00:55.500 --> 00:58.100
So aggregation definitely helps

00:58.100 --> 00:59.600
It's not always possible though

00:59.600 --> 01:04.100
It could be the case that there is what's called a multi Home customer

01:04.100 --> 01:09.600
So one that's for various reasons might want to have multiple providers for backup

01:09.600 --> 01:10.500
Reliability etcetera

01:10.500 --> 01:16.300
So then the internet would need to know how to reach these particular destinations through both providers

01:16.300 --> 01:20.800
And this this route to this network

01:20.800 --> 01:25.000
Would need to have the 23 bed masks visible

01:25.000 --> 01:27.300
instead of just a 24

01:28.300 --> 01:37.700
So making the scalable is in part based on just the demand growth of devices

01:37.700 --> 01:39.200
getting connected to the internet

01:39.200 --> 01:48.900
What what does Charter showing is basically time and years versus how many active bgp in trees

01:48.900 --> 01:49.300
There are

01:49.300 --> 01:53.100
And we can I see a bit how this

01:53.100 --> 01:55.300
how the size of the internet grew

01:55.300 --> 01:56.000
So initially

01:56.000 --> 01:57.800
there was a super linear growth

01:57.800 --> 02:00.600
There wasn't any aggregation Cedar

02:00.600 --> 02:07.200
which we've discussed was introduced and the aggregation that it allowed and able to linear growth

02:08.100 --> 02:09.300
The internet

02:09.300 --> 02:12.400
boom started a little bit before

02:12.400 --> 02:13.500
Mm

02:13.500 --> 02:18.700
So there was a super linear growth hear some chili

02:18.700 --> 02:24.100
Looks like an exponential growth multihoming would drive the super linear growth

02:24.100 --> 02:30.400
The.com bubble occurred and the growth sort of stopped for a couple years

02:30.400 --> 02:39.500
but then it's continued and continued on with an exponential growth financial crisis around 2008 caused that to drop a little bit

02:39.500 --> 02:40.900
but now it's continued to grow

02:40.900 --> 02:45.700
So all this is really led to why were using things like IPv6 now

02:45.700 --> 02:47.600
which we haven't talked too much detail about

02:47.600 --> 02:51.400
but it's a bit more complicated than ipv4 that we focused on

02:51.400 --> 02:54.000
But it's going to come back to an issue of

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Do we even have enough IP addresses that

02:57.800 --> 03:02.800
So we need to mention a couple of special-purpose address blocks that we have in particular

03:02.800 --> 03:03.600
discussed yet

03:03.600 --> 03:08.900
So their private addresses I'm in this is by standardization or green mint

03:08.900 --> 03:10.900
These are not route to the public internet

03:10.900 --> 03:12.700
So these are for networks

03:12.700 --> 03:14.000
not meant for general

03:14.000 --> 03:14.800
internet connectivity

03:14.800 --> 03:18.400
So these to find your standard land

03:18.400 --> 03:21.200
internal IP addresses

03:21.200 --> 03:23.000
So thing with anything in this black

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
starting with ten

03:24.000 --> 03:25.200
anything

03:25.200 --> 03:26.800
starting with 172

03:26.800 --> 03:28.900
16, and then anyting

03:28.900 --> 03:31.900
starting with 192

03:31.900 --> 03:32.500
168

03:34.600 --> 03:35.800
Additionally

03:35.800 --> 03:38.300
there's some address blocks that are called link-local

03:38.300 --> 03:40.000
so I can buy agreement

03:40.000 --> 03:41.300
These are not forwarded

03:41.300 --> 03:44.000
Not only not to the Internet by buy any router

03:44.000 --> 03:46.500
So these are used for single link communication

03:46.500 --> 03:52.100
Am I so need to be directly connected and this is after doing things like auto-configuration

03:52.100 --> 03:54.200
So if you've ever seen

03:54.200 --> 03:58.500
if your device has failed to connect to the internet to connect to a network

03:58.500 --> 04:01.300
if you get assigned automatically by your operating system

04:01.300 --> 04:04.400
and I feel like this starting 169

04:04.400 --> 04:05.100
254

04:05.100 --> 04:08.400
That's one of the links local standard addresses

04:10.000 --> 04:12.400
They're a couple other classes are special

04:12.400 --> 04:14.700
Addresses one is loopback addresses

04:14.700 --> 04:17.300
So this would correspond to the local machine

04:17.300 --> 04:20.300
This would be the Black starting 127

04:20.300 --> 04:20.800
0

04:20.800 --> 04:21.300
0

04:21.300 --> 04:26.900
0 usually only one of these was used which is 127

04:26.900 --> 04:27.300
0

04:27.300 --> 04:27.900
0.1

04:27.900 --> 04:37.800
So you'll probably run across that IP address before and the reason it's not going to be forwarded is it's just going to refer back to this local machine directly

04:37.800 --> 04:48.300
There also limited broadcast special-purpose addresses as well and needs to be sent to every host attached to the local network

04:48.300 --> 04:51.200
And this is for enabling broadcast to all the notes in the network

04:51.200 --> 04:55.800
the standard block for this would be 255, repeated

04:56.700 --> 04:59.800
So to summarize

04:59.800 --> 05:04.500
some of the scalability of hierarchical addressing has been critical for scalability

05:04.500 --> 05:11.200
So we don't require every node to know every other node or every router to know how to get to every other note

05:11.200 --> 05:15.000
It just needs to know how to get to every other network

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
So drastically

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
Reduces the amount of information required and it also makes it easier to propagate changes

05:22.000 --> 05:25.100
When something does change such as a failure

05:25.100 --> 05:30.900
the non-uniform hierarchy is also useful for having heterogeneous

05:30.900 --> 05:35.700
Networks are different sizes that initial class space addressing was too course

05:35.700 --> 05:42.400
which led to this development class lesson or two main routing or Cedar

05:42.400 --> 05:43.500
That's enabled

05:43.500 --> 05:47.600
Much more flexibility by providing arbitrary length prefixes
