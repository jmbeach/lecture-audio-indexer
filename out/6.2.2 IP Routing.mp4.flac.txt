FedEx are going to continue our discussion of the IP addressing by discussing which called cedar or classless interdomain routing. I would still be a little bit more complicated than how classful routing worked.
 Send Cedar. I will now use an arbitrary linked prefix to designate a particular Network. So we'll do this by using to 32-bit numbers to represent the network and the network number. I'll be composed of the IP address and this 32-bit mask. So, for example, if we have this IP, address, 12. 4.0.0 and this mask to 55. 254. 0. 0 in binary, we would encode this address as this numbers for this is 12. This is the for than the zero and the zero and we would Reserve.
 These lower bits essentially the bottom.
 About 17 bits for house. So we would be able to address, send it to to the 17 host and these upper bits would correspond to the network prefix. So, again, if we took the conjunction of the and between the bits, making up this address and this mask, that would then correspond to what network, we were indexing into and now, we're using an arbitrary length to prefix that Network. So notational in that slash notation. We were at the site. 12. 4. 0. 0, / 15 or 12:00. 4, / 15,
 So this Cedar mechanism is a way that addresses are allocated in a very hierarchical way for the on the internet. And using these prefix has a variable length is really key to making the internet scalable and how many devices can be connected to it? Because the addresses are allocated and contiguous chunks the prefixes, this lets us change the length of those prefixes and not just work with a few classes. So then the, the other important aspect of this prefix that's important is that the routing protocols, and doing packet, forwarding at the data plan, as we've seen is based on these prefix, addresses. So this is how we will figure out, okay, if I need the address to a particular hosts down here. Let's say this 12. 253. 64. 108. It's not quite a host there, so few computers behind there, but I could first start in this network. That's named 12.0.
 100. Then I figure out that it's in the 12. 250 3.0.0 Network than that. It's a particular subnetwork with the mat Network rights to this, hierarchical design. With these prefixes is how will enable scalability within the internet and that's what the cedar process allows us to do.
