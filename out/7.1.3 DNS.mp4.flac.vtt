00:01.000 --> 00:04.200
FedEx will discuss the mechanism within DNS

00:04.200 --> 00:09.800
That helps it perform better because as we saw with our example of a look up in the DNS system

00:09.800 --> 00:13.500
to find the IP address corresponding to the hostname

00:13.500 --> 00:15.800
Are we saw that it requires quite a few queries

00:15.800 --> 00:24.100
it would be better if we could integrate in some kind of a cashing mechanism to reduce all of those look UPS

00:24.100 --> 00:26.700
So that's what DNS cashing does

00:26.700 --> 00:27.800
And the reason again

00:27.800 --> 00:36.600
is that performing all those queries can take time and all of this time is before any of the actual communication

00:36.600 --> 00:38.600
We actually care about takes place

00:38.600 --> 00:39.200
So for example

00:39.200 --> 00:47.500
if it took one second before a web page would start to load every time I'd probably be fairly annoying

00:49.200 --> 00:58.900
So if we do use cash and we can greatly reduce the overhead part of the reason that we can take advantage of this is at those top-level domain

00:58.900 --> 01:00.000
servers are very rare

01:00.000 --> 01:01.500
They going to change ride

01:01.500 --> 01:02.100
So popular

01:02.100 --> 01:04.800
Sites like CNN.com are going to be visited a lot

01:04.800 --> 01:15.600
So then the local DNS server can have that information cashed so it doesn't have to go through all of those queries to figure out what the IP addresses for cnn.com

01:15.600 --> 01:23.700
So roughly how that would cashing process would work in DNS is the DNS servers would cash the responses to the queries

01:25.800 --> 01:28.500
So that the next time I look up with a court occur

01:28.500 --> 01:36.000
it doesn't have to go through that whole process of sending and receiving messages all the way up to the top level domain name server

01:36.000 --> 01:37.400
and the root DNS servers

01:37.400 --> 01:38.100
I'm at work

01:38.100 --> 01:40.300
Just know the answer of what the IP address says

01:40.300 --> 01:49.000
This response would also include a time to live field so that we know how long before were forced to

01:49.000 --> 01:53.600
I prefer the DNS server is forced to go look up that IP address again

01:53.600 --> 01:55.800
So after that would time would expire

01:55.800 --> 01:58.000
The server would delete that cashed in tree

01:58.900 --> 02:09.000
So there's another concept and cashing that can also help improve performance in particular usability

02:09.000 --> 02:10.900
That's called a negative cash

02:10.900 --> 02:14.000
And this would be remembering things that did not work

02:14.000 --> 02:14.600
So

02:14.600 --> 02:15.100
for example

02:15.100 --> 02:17.500
if you accidentally misspelled the domain name

02:17.500 --> 02:21.200
like if you put two M's or Miss type c

02:21.200 --> 02:22.600
n n and put three ends

02:25.200 --> 02:33.500
The only way that your computer figures out for the the look up figures out that these are probably not valid domain names

02:33.500 --> 02:36.500
is by going through that whole

02:36.500 --> 02:38.000
DNS querying process

02:38.000 --> 02:38.600
So

02:38.600 --> 02:40.900
you can send all those messages to figure out o

02:40.900 --> 02:43.600
this wasn't a valid domain name

02:43.600 --> 02:46.200
And then you look at the domain name and you see you mistyped it

02:46.200 --> 02:46.800
right

02:46.800 --> 02:48.100
Of course

02:48.100 --> 02:53.900
there could be other things like someone in expecting some misspellings of common names

02:53.900 --> 02:54.900
As register that domain

02:54.900 --> 02:58.700
It's actually a Spam side of some form asks

02:58.700 --> 03:06.500
for these things could take a long time to fail the first time because all of those lookups need to occur and you need to get that response back

03:08.000 --> 03:15.200
From an authoritative DNS server in the end that that there's no IP address corresponding to that to that pain

03:15.200 --> 03:17.900
So be good to remember things that don't work

03:17.900 --> 03:26.700
so that the failure would take less time the next time and not all of those messages would need to be sent to figure out that that server didn't exist at all

03:26.700 --> 03:28.200
Unfortunately

03:28.200 --> 03:30.500
this is an optional process

03:30.500 --> 03:31.000
And right now

03:31.000 --> 03:32.400
it's really not widely implemented

03:32.400 --> 03:44.800
But overall this cashing process we talked about primarily the positive cashing process that we would save the IP addresses corresponding to commonly looked up domain names so that the next look up

03:44.800 --> 03:46.000
isn't going to take nearly as long
