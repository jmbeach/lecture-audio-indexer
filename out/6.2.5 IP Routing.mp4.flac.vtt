00:00.300 --> 00:00.900
FedEx

00:00.900 --> 00:01.600
will discuss

00:01.600 --> 00:03.700
How IP addresses are allocated

00:03.700 --> 00:05.300
Particularly how

00:05.300 --> 00:07.200
the allocation of blocks of addresses

00:07.200 --> 00:12.500
worker will eventually get into how an IP address gets allocated for your own

00:12.500 --> 00:13.600
individual computer

00:13.600 --> 00:14.600
Say using a protocol

00:14.600 --> 00:15.600
like DHCP

00:16.600 --> 00:17.100
So

00:17.100 --> 00:22.300
how do you get one of these large blocks of addresses that we've talked about say for an organization

00:22.300 --> 00:23.200
Well

00:23.200 --> 00:25.500
we've seen how in class

00:25.500 --> 00:28.600
Classical addressing

00:28.600 --> 00:31.300
There's an assignment of a prefix to a particular institution

00:31.300 --> 00:32.000
like

00:32.000 --> 00:34.900
Vanderbilt as we discussed addresses

00:34.900 --> 00:40.600
then are assigned by those institutions to their notes inside of their network

00:40.600 --> 00:43.600
but who assigns these prefixes

00:43.600 --> 00:44.900
So

00:44.900 --> 00:47.800
there's an organization that does this

00:47.800 --> 00:54.000
So I can does this and it allocates large address box to Regional internet

00:54.000 --> 00:54.800
Registries

00:54.800 --> 00:55.100
but

00:55.100 --> 00:58.700
there's some politics involved in this there

00:58.700 --> 01:00.100
Then Regional internet

01:00.100 --> 01:02.400
registries are ours

01:02.400 --> 01:04.000
Such as Aaron

01:04.000 --> 01:05.700
in the United States

01:05.700 --> 01:09.000
this allocate address blocks within their given regions

01:09.800 --> 01:13.000
You should be say allocated to isps

01:13.000 --> 01:14.200
as well as large institutions

01:14.200 --> 01:16.800
Both of which should be done for her payment

01:16.800 --> 01:18.800
Then is PS

01:18.800 --> 01:21.600
So say your service provider at your

01:21.600 --> 01:22.600
for your home internet

01:22.600 --> 01:29.900
These would allocate address box for their customers could be recursive in this typically is going to be a recurring

01:29.900 --> 01:31.500
sort of

01:31.500 --> 01:35.600
without additional charge beyond what you already paid for your internet service

01:35.600 --> 01:37.200
but for example

01:37.200 --> 01:40.200
sometimes if you wanted to have such a dedicated IP address

01:40.200 --> 01:45.500
you might pay for that service to have that IP address assigned to your home

01:45.500 --> 01:48.400
If you say ran a server that needed

01:48.400 --> 01:50.600
that kind of a dedicated IP address

01:51.800 --> 01:56.100
So how do we figure out who owns an address while their address Registries

01:56.100 --> 02:00.200
This is a public record of how the addresses are allocated

02:00.200 --> 02:03.300
This is how this is in part how

02:03.300 --> 02:04.000
For example

02:04.000 --> 02:17.400
if you browse to a website these days it'll automatically detect what country or what location you're in a potentially even what organization you're with the ISP should also update if they're giving addresses to customers

02:17.400 --> 02:20.600
But these records of course there are often out of date

02:20.600 --> 02:25.900
So there are a couple ways to figure out who owns that address so you can run a command like

02:25.900 --> 02:36.400
who is there a variety of tools to run who has and you could look up who owns a particular IP address or block of IP addresses

02:36.400 --> 02:39.100
And what organization is a sign that block

02:40.100 --> 02:47.700
So you probably inferred and our discussion of ipv4 versus IPv6

02:47.700 --> 02:51.700
Probably having 32-bit addresses isn't quite enough

02:51.700 --> 02:54.700
So this is a lot of unique addresses

02:54.700 --> 02:57.600
but it's not enough for how many devices are connected to the internet

02:57.600 --> 03:00.800
So how many addresses could we

03:00.800 --> 03:04.100
how many different computers are notes

03:04.100 --> 03:05.900
When we represent with 32 bits

03:05.900 --> 03:06.500
While to

03:06.500 --> 03:08.600
to the 32 is a bit over four million

03:08.600 --> 03:13.600
So we could have four billion unique addresses for devices connected to the internet

03:13.600 --> 03:14.900
But as we saw

03:14.900 --> 03:17.100
there are reserved special purpose

03:17.100 --> 03:17.700
blocks

03:17.700 --> 03:22.200
and some addresses are allocated in large blocks to organizations

03:22.200 --> 03:24.100
perhaps that are using all of them

03:25.000 --> 03:28.600
But now because we're connecting more and more things to the internet

03:28.600 --> 03:29.500
many of

03:29.500 --> 03:30.500
which fact

03:30.500 --> 03:33.200
all of which are going to need IP addresses of some form

03:33.200 --> 03:35.300
such as an internet of things

03:35.300 --> 03:40.400
We do already have more than four billion devices connected to the internet

03:40.400 --> 03:42.900
So a longer-term solution

03:42.900 --> 03:47.800
which is in part will lead to IPv6, is that we now have a 128 bits for addresses

03:47.800 --> 03:52.900
So that should be about 3.4 x 10 to the 38th devices

03:52.900 --> 03:57.700
So hopefully this larger at address space will be sufficient for handling

03:57.700 --> 04:01.400
The scalability growth of the number of devices connected to the internet

04:01.400 --> 04:08.400
There are some other shorter-term solutions for continuing to use ipv4 because it is still widely used

04:08.400 --> 04:15.000
As we discussed trying to switch the internet layer protocol have ipv4 the network layer protocol

04:15.000 --> 04:23.300
That ipv4s is very difficult because it's the commonality between the link later and lower layer

04:23.300 --> 04:24.100
Protocols

04:24.100 --> 04:25.000
and the applique

04:24.900 --> 04:26.100
10 layer protocols

04:26.100 --> 04:28.300
So using private addresses

04:28.300 --> 04:30.500
as one solution using network

04:30.500 --> 04:30.900
address translation

04:30.900 --> 04:33.200
which will discuss shortly is another solution

04:33.200 --> 04:40.900
And partially using a dynamic assignment of addresses which enables unique private addresses

04:40.900 --> 04:43.200
say hidden behind a router

04:43.200 --> 04:48.900
If you have saved several computers at your home connected behind one router

04:48.900 --> 04:59.900
so we're going to talk more next about how Network address translation would work and would help us address this limitation of only having 32-bit addresses
