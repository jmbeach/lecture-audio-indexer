So next, we're going to continue some discussion of scalability and how IP addresses get allocated as well as some other special-purpose IP addresses that we haven't yet discussed.
 So has reportedly seen with prefixing. Also noticed this address aggregation. This is one mechanism through which will enable scalability. So, for example, if a provider has given these two addresses starting 2:01. 10 corresponding to this range of addresses, 201. 10. 0, through. 7 than anything. And that's based on this 21 mask. So then, the provider could assign these in any way they like and the routers and the rest of the internet would only need to know how to reach this provider. They don't need to know any additional information about these individual customers.
 So aggregation definitely helps. It's not always possible though. It could be the case that there is what's called a multi Home customer. So one that's for various reasons might want to have multiple providers for backup. Reliability etcetera. So then the internet would need to know how to reach these particular destinations through both providers. And this this route to this network. Would need to have the 23 bed masks visible, instead of just a 24
 So making the scalable is in part based on just the demand growth of devices, getting connected to the internet. What what does Charter showing is basically time and years versus how many active bgp in trees? There are. And we can I see a bit how this, how the size of the internet grew. So initially, there was a super linear growth. There wasn't any aggregation Cedar, which we've discussed was introduced and the aggregation that it allowed and able to linear growth.
 The internet, boom started a little bit before. Mm. So there was a super linear growth hear some chili. Looks like an exponential growth multihoming would drive the super linear growth. The.com bubble occurred and the growth sort of stopped for a couple years, but then it's continued and continued on with an exponential growth financial crisis around 2008 caused that to drop a little bit, but now it's continued to grow. So all this is really led to why were using things like IPv6 now, which we haven't talked too much detail about, but it's a bit more complicated than ipv4 that we focused on. But it's going to come back to an issue of. Do we even have enough IP addresses that?
 So we need to mention a couple of special-purpose address blocks that we have in particular, discussed yet. So their private addresses I'm in this is by standardization or green mint. These are not route to the public internet. So these are for networks, not meant for general, internet connectivity. So these to find your standard land, internal IP addresses. So thing with anything in this black, starting with ten, anything, starting with 172. 16, and then anyting, starting with 192. 168.
 Additionally, there's some address blocks that are called link-local, so I can buy agreement. These are not forwarded. Not only not to the Internet by buy any router. So these are used for single link communication. Am I so need to be directly connected and this is after doing things like auto-configuration. So if you've ever seen, if your device has failed to connect to the internet to connect to a network, if you get assigned automatically by your operating system, and I feel like this starting 169. 254. That's one of the links local standard addresses.
 They're a couple other classes are special. Addresses one is loopback addresses. So this would correspond to the local machine. This would be the Black starting 127. 0. 0. 0 usually only one of these was used which is 127. 0. 0.1. So you'll probably run across that IP address before and the reason it's not going to be forwarded is it's just going to refer back to this local machine directly. There also limited broadcast special-purpose addresses as well and needs to be sent to every host attached to the local network. And this is for enabling broadcast to all the notes in the network, the standard block for this would be 255, repeated.
 So to summarize, some of the scalability of hierarchical addressing has been critical for scalability. So we don't require every node to know every other node or every router to know how to get to every other note. It just needs to know how to get to every other network. So drastically. Reduces the amount of information required and it also makes it easier to propagate changes. When something does change such as a failure, the non-uniform hierarchy is also useful for having heterogeneous. Networks are different sizes that initial class space addressing was too course, which led to this development class lesson or two main routing or Cedar. That's enabled. Much more flexibility by providing arbitrary length prefixes.
