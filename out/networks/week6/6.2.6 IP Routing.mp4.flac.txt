Now, we'll discuss Network address translation, which as we introduced earlier is going to be one of the mechanisms that will be used to address the limited number of IP addresses that are available for usage.
 So, what is Network address translation? Why do we have it? Well, before we had naps, let's go back to that time every machine. So every computer that was connected to the internet, would have a unique IP address. So, for example, if we have two clients connected up to the Internet, one might have IP address 1, 2, 3 4. And the other one, one, two, three five. So that when this computer 1 2 3 4 cents information over, let's say it's a request for web traffic on Port. 80, it would send as well as a local court that was used for say the web client that sending that request your web server located at over on the server. And this is just part of what the IP actually the TCP header would look like to this print. The TCP header that has the transport layer information of the port, this part, the IP a door that has
 The information about the particular addressing should send that to the server. The destination address presumably would get routed over to the server.
 And server would figure out what was requested. It would then produce a message that. Okay. I'm sending back to Port 1001 so that the information, it goes back to the say web client running on computer with address 1234. So, that's how things would work before we had napped. However, we only have about four billion IP addresses. So independently a sighting addresses to every computer connected to the Internet isn't going to work. We have too many devices their way over four billion devices connected. So instead we'll use a private address block. One of those special purpose blocks. We've talked about a standard one. Is this 192. 168. 0. 0 and then what we'll do is we'll use the additional information. We have through port numbers, to perform this, to perform a multiplexing, Andy multiplexing, process to figure out the appropriate internal address.
 So now instead of having the clients assigned, addresses like 1 2 3 4 and 1 2 3 5. Only the router is assigned a public IP address 1234. And now the clients are assigned. Private IP addresses, starting with 192.
 So now, when client 1 9 2. 2. 3. 4 say, does the same web request to get information. It's using Port 1001. Let's say if it sends that request out the router. Now, would take this information and it would rewrite that private address that's used along with the port from the process that sent this request out on host at 4. It would rewrite that address and replace the IP, header IP and TCP IP Header information to now, use the public IP address 1, 2, 3 4 with a Newport. That it's selected.
 So it would modify the package and change the packet header, to use that new from or Source address for where the information request was coming from. So that when it sent over to the server, the server knows how to respond it receives this request, Rhian codes a response back to send it back to.
 The router with address 1234. I'd also encodes that port address. That was sent with the request. So now and the router receives it, it knows because it kept track of Court. Mm, corresponding to the IP address. 192. 2. 3. 4 from the process running at Port 1001 on that client. Okay. So now it would have decoded that it would. Now rewrite the IP address replace the two thousand with the appropriate port and replace the public-address that it received with the appropriate client address.
 All right, so that would go on down to the client. And basically this is the mechanism that gets used with an app to use the port numbers to do the multiplexing, Andy multiplexing to internal addresses. So if we instead had something from the other client, if it sent two request out, we could then assign it a different part number and we could rewrite the IP and TCP header is using that Newport number and a similar process would occur at the server would rewrite to send back to the public IP address with this new port, number that corresponds to the client. 5.
 So that as it comes back the router would then rewrite the address. The 192. 2.3.5 with the appropriate number say 1001, right? Cuz I did receive a packet that had been labeled with port number 2001. So now that information would get back to the client.
 That's basically how that would work. That's the general process for that and that is widely used your, possibly using it. Now, if you're connected behind a router and if you're using an ipv4 and IPv6, so let's just come back to a few final issues that we've brought up in terms of scalability of the internet. So how much address space, which they should we allocate for particular, geographic region. Should it be related to population or should we give every country in equal number? What about this, allocation has been going on for a long time. What do we do about addresses already allocated? What about address space portability? Can you keep your address block? If you change providers sort of like keeping your phone number? That would be good and that you don't have to remember your network equipment, but it might might reduce the effectiveness of having address. Organ aggregation. What about keeping the ad?
 Registries up-to-date. So, what if companies merge or acquire, their lot of potential issues that can arise in determining how to allocate addresses? So we won't try to solve all these things to be aware of that if made some of the way that IPS IP addresses are allocated, fairly complicated.
 Set of summarize everything we've discussed with IP address thing we talked about for ipv4 how a 32-bit number is to identify interfaces the allocation of these using prefixes. I sort of like again basically using zip codes with postal mail or area codes with phone numbers using things like Cedar and having a non-uniform hierarchy enable scalability using the prefix has to route to specific networks. Vs. Individual hosts is very effective. And as one of the key drivers of scalability, there are several special-purpose blocks that we discussed Reserve to a particularly for handling local addressing. How the addressing allocation occurs is a process involving a variety of organizations such as I can the regional registrars the IP, isps your service provider, your own internal organization that work if it's just a home network, not a big deal.
 But if you're not going to station or a business, some issues there for how to resolve all that, finally down to a host and what'll be coming up in some of the later lectures that we haven't completely discussed is how a horse would get assigned. Addresses say on a customer internal Network that's typically done with DHCP.
 How we would perform a mapping from an IP address to a link address? That's done with the protocol called ARP. And then how we would map from human-readable hosts are domain names, like, saved, vanderbilt.edu, to a particular IP address and that's done with the DNS server. In a cover, these three topics and some later lectures, which will sort of wrap up how addressing occurs across the various layers that we've seen within the TCP IP and at Westside models.
