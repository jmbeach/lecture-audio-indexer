00:00.000 --> 00:03.900
It's a building on our discussion of hierarchical IP address saying

00:03.900 --> 00:20.900
we're not going to talk about two different classes of IP addresses and what's called classful routing and then we'll eventually get into some other details about how more complicated modern internet routing actually is so I'm class full address

00:20.900 --> 00:25.800
Seeing what we do is we assign prefix has to correspond a particular classes

00:25.800 --> 00:31.600
So Class A would correspond to the first bite

00:31.600 --> 00:43.000
So this most significant bite being in this range 0 to 1:27, so it'd be / 8 in the / notation

00:43.000 --> 00:49.700
So what the prefix is required to be as the top most significant bit here is his hero

00:49.700 --> 00:50.800
So this of course

00:50.800 --> 00:52.300
find a very large blocks

00:52.300 --> 00:52.900
So for example

00:52.900 --> 00:56.200
the mighty as this block of all addresses

00:56.200 --> 00:57.300
starting with 18

00:57.300 --> 00:58.400
So 18

00:58.400 --> 00:59.100
Anything

00:59.100 --> 00:59.700
Anything

00:59.700 --> 00:59.900
Any

01:01.100 --> 01:02.500
Class B

01:02.500 --> 01:10.200
Then corresponds to the first bite being in the range 128 to 191 again here

01:10.200 --> 01:13.000
we would now assume in / 60 notation

01:13.000 --> 01:16.800
And the prefix here would be that the top best AR-10

01:16.800 --> 01:19.000
So this should be pretty large blocks

01:19.000 --> 01:20.300
So for example

01:20.300 --> 01:23.300
of Vanderbilt has this block of IP addresses

01:23.300 --> 01:29.900
so everything's starting with one 29.50 9.0.0

01:29.900 --> 01:31.200
Okay

01:31.200 --> 01:33.900
so so the zeros can be any number

01:35.500 --> 01:46.400
Classy then corresponds to having this prefix and the top number could be anything in the range 192-2223

01:46.400 --> 01:50.900
So this would also assume in / 24 notation

01:50.900 --> 01:54.300
and the prefix here would be the 110

01:54.300 --> 01:55.100
Okay

01:55.100 --> 01:56.900
So this should be fairly small blocks

01:56.900 --> 02:02.200
These are going to be groups of 2:55 or so since it's / 24 notation

02:02.200 --> 02:08.100
This is groups of two to the 16 or about 60,000 computers could be addressed

02:08.100 --> 02:11.100
The should be two to the 24

02:11.100 --> 02:14.200
So a lot of computers could be addressed here

02:14.200 --> 02:16.400
has to be smaller blocks

02:16.400 --> 02:18.700
So this would be in part

02:18.700 --> 02:20.300
Many European networks Judah

02:20.300 --> 02:21.700
Historical reasons

02:22.300 --> 02:26.200
There's some other classes class D and classy

02:26.200 --> 02:34.600
These are less widely used but to to 42239 are the top betzer 1110

02:34.600 --> 02:44.600
Is it be multicast groups for handling simultaneous communication between multiple receiving nodes or classy in this is mostly reserve for future

02:44.600 --> 02:45.100
Use

02:45.100 --> 02:46.800
There are some special purpose

02:46.800 --> 02:57.300
addresses with them at these rough classes with then basically Define what addresses are going to correspond to which particular networks are the

02:57.300 --> 03:00.100
Most commonly used ones are going to be a b and c

03:01.700 --> 03:06.000
So there are some issues that have been classical routing can lead to

03:06.000 --> 03:07.600
So we only have a few sizes

03:07.600 --> 03:08.600
basically a b

03:08.600 --> 03:08.900
and c

03:08.900 --> 03:17.700
and a problem that can arise as routers can end up knowing a lot about Class C networks because there's so many of them because they're quite small

03:17.700 --> 03:19.400
So we need to be able to address these issues

03:19.400 --> 03:28.000
So that the size of the internet can scale up more reasonably as the number of devices and interfaces connected increase
