The next we're going to discuss IP address setting in a bit more detail into. Begin that discussion. We were going to talk a little more depth about what some of that content is included in the IP pocket headers. So where we're headed with the IP address thing is after we introduced a bit more detail in the iip had her information. When you talk about IP fragmentation, and then we're going to talk about for ipv4, how addressing works at particularly a couple more sophisticated addressing mechanisms specifically, classless entered interdomain routing Cedar as well as Network address translation.
So the IP packet header we've seen this before, but it looks like this, there's some Heather information and then there's also a payload. So, what's included in this Header? Information would include things like the version of Ip being used to sit before me, sex, at cetera, with the length of the header is, as well as types of service. So what are some of those things mean? So the version number would be encoded with four bits and it would indicate what version of the IP protocols being used. So this would be necessary to know what other fields to expect. Cuz it could change. So typically it's still ipv4. But increasingly IPv6 going to talk about why things would move to IPv6. Eventually they had her. Length would include how many 32-bit words are in the header. It would typically be 5, which should correspond to 20 byte, ipv4 header. It could be
More when various IP options are used as though, the type of service, then is eight bits in the header and it would allow packets to be treated differently based on what needs are. So, for example, maybe they're slow delay for audio high bandwidth for a bulk transfer, another type type of service criteria, that may be useful for routers to know, along the way as well as for a destination node. That's receiving information.
So if your other pieces have been the total length corresponding to how big the payload is some additional information for whether the tea packet has been fragmented. And we're going to talk in more depth about that shortly. And then, of course, some of the other critical information like what the source IP addresses that we talked about previously, or with the destination IP address is
