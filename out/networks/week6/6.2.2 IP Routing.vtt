00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
FedEx are going to continue our discussion of the IP addressing by discussing which called cedar or classless interdomain routing

00:07.600 --> 00:12.800
I would still be a little bit more complicated than how classful routing worked

00:13.600 --> 00:14.700
Send Cedar

00:14.700 --> 00:20.600
I will now use an arbitrary linked prefix to designate a particular Network

00:20.600 --> 00:27.000
So we'll do this by using to 32-bit numbers to represent the network and the network number

00:27.000 --> 00:31.500
I'll be composed of the IP address and this 32-bit mask

00:31.500 --> 00:32.200
So

00:32.200 --> 00:32.600
for example

00:32.600 --> 00:34.000
if we have this IP

00:34.000 --> 00:34.400
address

00:34.400 --> 00:35.200
12

00:35.200 --> 00:42.500
4.0.0 and this mask to 55

00:42.500 --> 00:43.500
254

00:43.500 --> 00:44.100
0

00:44.100 --> 00:46.100
0 in binary

00:46.100 --> 00:51.100
we would encode this address as this numbers for this is 12

00:51.100 --> 00:56.400
This is the for than the zero and the zero and we would Reserve

00:57.400 --> 01:01.300
These lower bits essentially the bottom

01:03.200 --> 01:05.600
About 17 bits for house

01:05.600 --> 01:06.700
So we would be able to address

01:06.700 --> 01:13.100
send it to to the 17 host and these upper bits would correspond to the network prefix

01:13.100 --> 01:14.100
So

01:14.100 --> 01:14.400
again

01:14.400 --> 01:17.400
if we took the conjunction of the and between the bits

01:17.400 --> 01:19.400
making up this address and this mask

01:19.400 --> 01:21.800
that would then correspond to what network

01:21.800 --> 01:24.100
we were indexing into and now

01:24.100 --> 01:27.500
we're using an arbitrary length to prefix that Network

01:27.500 --> 01:30.200
So notational in that slash notation

01:30.200 --> 01:30.900
We were at the site

01:30.900 --> 01:31.600
12

01:31.600 --> 01:32.000
4

01:32.000 --> 01:32.600
0

01:32.600 --> 01:35.400
0, / 15 or 12:00

01:35.400 --> 01:36.700
4, / 15,

01:37.500 --> 01:45.500
So this Cedar mechanism is a way that addresses are allocated in a very hierarchical way for the on the internet

01:45.500 --> 01:55.200
And using these prefix has a variable length is really key to making the internet scalable and how many devices can be connected to it

01:55.200 --> 02:00.700
Because the addresses are allocated and contiguous chunks the prefixes

02:00.700 --> 02:06.900
this lets us change the length of those prefixes and not just work with a few classes

02:06.900 --> 02:08.000
So then the

02:08.000 --> 02:13.900
the other important aspect of this prefix that's important is that the routing protocols

02:13.900 --> 02:14.800
and doing packet

02:14.800 --> 02:16.000
forwarding at the data plan

02:16.000 --> 02:18.500
as we've seen is based on these prefix

02:18.500 --> 02:19.200
addresses

02:19.200 --> 02:21.100
So this is how we will figure out

02:21.100 --> 02:22.200
okay

02:22.200 --> 02:25.800
if I need the address to a particular hosts down here

02:25.800 --> 02:27.400
Let's say this 12

02:27.400 --> 02:28.600
253

02:28.600 --> 02:29.400
64

02:29.400 --> 02:29.900
108

02:29.900 --> 02:31.000
It's not quite a host there

02:31.000 --> 02:32.500
so few computers behind there

02:32.500 --> 02:35.700
but I could first start in this network

02:35.700 --> 02:37.400
That's named 12.0

02:37.500 --> 02:38.700
100

02:38.700 --> 02:42.200
Then I figure out that it's in the 12

02:42.200 --> 02:47.000
250 3.0.0 Network than that

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
It's a particular subnetwork with the mat Network rights to this

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
hierarchical design

02:53.000 --> 03:02.600
With these prefixes is how will enable scalability within the internet and that's what the cedar process allows us to do
