FedEx, will discuss. How IP addresses are allocated? Particularly how, the allocation of blocks of addresses, worker will eventually get into how an IP address gets allocated for your own, individual computer. Say using a protocol, like DHCP.
 So, how do you get one of these large blocks of addresses that we've talked about say for an organization? Well, we've seen how in class. Classical addressing. There's an assignment of a prefix to a particular institution, like, Vanderbilt as we discussed addresses, then are assigned by those institutions to their notes inside of their network, but who assigns these prefixes. So, there's an organization that does this. So I can does this and it allocates large address box to Regional internet. Registries, but, there's some politics involved in this there. Then Regional internet, registries are ours. Such as Aaron, in the United States, this allocate address blocks within their given regions.
 You should be say allocated to isps, as well as large institutions. Both of which should be done for her payment. Then is PS. So say your service provider at your, for your home internet. These would allocate address box for their customers could be recursive in this typically is going to be a recurring, sort of, without additional charge beyond what you already paid for your internet service, but for example, sometimes if you wanted to have such a dedicated IP address, you might pay for that service to have that IP address assigned to your home. If you say ran a server that needed, that kind of a dedicated IP address.
 So how do we figure out who owns an address while their address Registries? This is a public record of how the addresses are allocated. This is how this is in part how. For example, if you browse to a website these days it'll automatically detect what country or what location you're in a potentially even what organization you're with the ISP should also update if they're giving addresses to customers. But these records of course there are often out of date. So there are a couple ways to figure out who owns that address so you can run a command like, who is there a variety of tools to run who has and you could look up who owns a particular IP address or block of IP addresses? And what organization is a sign that block?
 So you probably inferred and our discussion of ipv4 versus IPv6. Probably having 32-bit addresses isn't quite enough. So this is a lot of unique addresses, but it's not enough for how many devices are connected to the internet. So how many addresses could we, how many different computers are notes? When we represent with 32 bits? While to, to the 32 is a bit over four million. So we could have four billion unique addresses for devices connected to the internet. But as we saw, there are reserved special purpose, blocks, and some addresses are allocated in large blocks to organizations, perhaps that are using all of them.
 But now because we're connecting more and more things to the internet, many of, which fact, all of which are going to need IP addresses of some form, such as an internet of things. We do already have more than four billion devices connected to the internet. So a longer-term solution, which is in part will lead to IPv6, is that we now have a 128 bits for addresses. So that should be about 3.4 x 10 to the 38th devices. So hopefully this larger at address space will be sufficient for handling. The scalability growth of the number of devices connected to the internet. There are some other shorter-term solutions for continuing to use ipv4 because it is still widely used. As we discussed trying to switch the internet layer protocol have ipv4 the network layer protocol. That ipv4s is very difficult because it's the commonality between the link later and lower layer. Protocols, and the applique
 10 layer protocols. So using private addresses, as one solution using network, address translation, which will discuss shortly is another solution. And partially using a dynamic assignment of addresses which enables unique private addresses, say hidden behind a router. If you have saved several computers at your home connected behind one router, so we're going to talk more next about how Network address translation would work and would help us address this limitation of only having 32-bit addresses.
