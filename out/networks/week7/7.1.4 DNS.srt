00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So we'll continue
discussing DNS,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and next we'll discuss
some of the DNS protocol

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and what some of the
data and commands,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.060 align:middle line:84%
the sends and receives,
requests/replies

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.300 align:middle line:84%
in the DNS protocol, what
those are going to look like.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So what the information
in DNS is typically called

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.390 align:middle line:90%
are called resource records.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And remember, as
we've introduced DNS,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.350 align:middle line:84%
we've described it as being
a distributed database that

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.420 align:middle line:90%
stores information.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's storing
these resource records.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's a format
of these consisting

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
of a name, a value, a type,
and a time to live, if any.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So there are several
types of DNS records.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Type A is kind of
the simplest type,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and that would
consist of a name that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.960 align:middle line:84%
is the hostname and a value
that's the IP address.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is the direct mapping
from a hostname into an IP

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:90%
address.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Another type in these record
resource formats is a type NS.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Here the name is a
domain, so say foo.com,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and the value is a hostname
of an authoritative name

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:90%
server for that domain.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
For the reverse
lookups, the type PTR

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
would be the name represented
in that reverse quad notation

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:84%
for doing reverse lookups,
and then the value

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:84%
would be the
corresponding hostname

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:84%
so that we could go from IP
address into that hostname.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Another type is
called a CNAME, which

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:90%
stands for canonical name.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And what this corresponds
to is name mapping

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:90%
to a canonical value.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the
address www.cs.mit.edu

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
really could correspond to the
canonical name eecsweb.mit.edu.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.938 align:middle line:84%
So this would let you give
some aliases essentially.

00:02:03.938 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
A final type, which we
won't talk too much about,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:90%
but is an MX type.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And the value for
this would be the name

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.945 align:middle line:84%
of a mail server associated
with a particular domain name.

00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It could include some other
optional information as well.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So within the DNS
protocol, there

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.462 align:middle line:84%
are two types of messages,
queries and replies,

00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and they both have
the same message

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:90%
format which looks like this.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So the message header
consists of a variety

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:90%
of pieces of information.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:84%
These are broken
into 16-bit portions.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
The message header includes
a 16-bit number corresponding

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:90%
to the query.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
The reply to this query would
then use that same number

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:84%
so you know you're
getting a response back,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
basically just labeling or
identifying the query number,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Flags that could
be set are options

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:84%
like whether the type of
message is a query or a reply,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
whether recursion is
desired or allowed,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:84%
or whether a reply is from an
authoritative source or not.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:84%
There would be other
fields including

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.720 align:middle line:84%
the size of optional
header elements

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.855 align:middle line:84%
that we won't talk
about in depth.

00:03:17.855 --> 00:03:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do
next to try to understand

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more
about how DNS works is

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:84%
we'll go through an interactive
lookup using the Unix program

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:90%
called Dig.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
What this lets you do is it
lets you query the DNS system,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and then it will dump the
field from the DNS responses,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:84%
so basically looking at
these DNS protocol messages.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So by default, it would
execute recursive queries

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:84%
which you can disable
via this option just

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:84%
to set that it's not
recursive so it's just going

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:90%
to operate one step at a time.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're going
to do through this quick

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%
demonstration of this.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's suppose we want to look
up the IP address for cnn.com,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:90%
specifically, www.cnn.com.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to query
one of the root servers.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
The root servers, again,
they're labeled A through M,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and you can access them through
this root-servers.net domain

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:90%
name.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you run this
command, you'd

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
get back some responses, some
header information, of course.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
In this case, you're
sending a query out.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
The question that you're looking
for is, what is the A name?

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what's the IP address
corresponding to cnn.com?

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:90%
There's no answer section yet.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Then there's some
authoritative information

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:84%
which is just
representing the various,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:84%
for this top-level domain,
com where you could look up

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:90%
to figure out that answer.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So just going on
within the same query,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:84%
there would be additional
information corresponding

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:04.410 align:middle line:84%
to what these top-level
domain name server names would

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:90%
correspond to in IP addresses.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:90%
So we can see that, say--

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.340 align:middle line:84%
let's look at the G one,
the G.GTLD-SERVERS.NET.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:84%
The A name record for that would
correspond to this IP address,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.985 align:middle line:90%
this 192.42.93.30.

00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
There'd be some timing
information for this

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:90%
and which server had replied.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
If we go back and look,
we asked the root server

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
labeled A. That's the
server that had replied.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So after we figured out,
OK, I can go look up at A--

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
what this response
means is that I

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
can go ask now this root
server with the subdomain A

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:90%
how to get to cnn.com.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, we didn't run this
in the recursive mode.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So now, if I ask one of the
top-level domain servers how

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:90%
to get to cnn.com--

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.455 align:middle line:84%
I'll just pick one of
them that had replied--

00:05:58.455 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
what we'll see now in some
of the responses for cnn.com,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:84%
we could access that with
this other domain name,

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.495 align:middle line:90%
so this twdns-01.ns.aol.com.

00:06:15.495 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So that'd be the domain
name server for cnn.com.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Then there'd be some additional
information encoding,

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:84%
what are the actual IP
addresses corresponding

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
to those hostnames for
those domain name servers?

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So moving along then, so
we'll do one more query.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:84%
If we now go query one of those
particular domain name servers,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:84%
we just picked one of them
arbitrarily out of the four

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
that came back with a
response and we ask it

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
what the IP address
for www.cnn.com

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
is, that was the question
that we asked that DNS server.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're asking it, what is
the IP address corresponding

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:90%
to that domain name?

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The response back that
we get and the answer

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
from the DNS system
is that www.cnn.com

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
is a CNAME or an
alias for cnn.com.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And then any of
these IP addresses

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
should work if you want
to access www.cnn.com.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you typed in your web
browser any of these addresses,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
they should all
take you to cnn.com.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So there could be more
than one, as you can see.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And this could be for various
load balancing reasons

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.740 align:middle line:84%
that we've mentioned
a little bit earlier,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:84%
having these geographically
distributed so that perhaps

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
a lookup or accessing that
website would be faster

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:84%
in a certain region
of the world,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.150 align:middle line:84%
and you might be directed
to use a particular one

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:84%
of those servers based
on that kind of criteria.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But this is how we would
have sort of manually

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.460 align:middle line:84%
gone through that
process of getting

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.326 align:middle line:84%
what IP address
corresponded to www.cnn.com.

00:08:01.326 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little bit of an
overview of the DNS protocol,

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:84%
the different types of resource
records like A name, CNAMEs,

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and what some of the
information would

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.820 align:middle line:84%
look like when the
queries and the DNS system

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:90%
are actually occurring.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.454 align:middle line:90%
