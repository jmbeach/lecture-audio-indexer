so what continue discussing DNS and next, we'll discuss some of the DNS protocol and what some of the data and commands, the sends and receives requests replies in the DNS protocol with us are going to look like
 So what the information in DNS, this typically called or called resource records, and remember, as we've introduced DNS, we've described it as being a distributed database, that stores information in this case of storing, these resource records. So, there's a format of these consisting of the name of value, a type, and a time to live. So, there are several types of DNS records Taipei is kind of the simplest type in, that would consist of a name. That is the host name, and a value. That's the IP address. So this is the direct mapping from a hostname into an IP address.
 Another type in these record resource formats as a type B & S hear the name is a domain. So, say food.com. And the value is a hostname of an authoritative name server for that domain.
 For the reverse lookups that type PTR would be the name. Represented in that River Squad, notation for doing reverse lookups. And then the value would be the corresponding host name so that we can go from IP address into that hostname. Another type is called a cname or for which stands for canonical name and what this corresponds to an a mapping to a canonical value ride. So for example, the address www.ccs.edu really could correspond to the canonical name, eecs web.mit.edu. So this would let you give that some of the Alias is essentially a final type with you and talk to you much about. But is a m x type and the value for this would be the name of a male server associated with a particular domain. Name could include some other option one formation as well.
 So within the DNS protocol there, two types of messages queries and replies and they both have the same message for Matt which looks like this. So the message header consists of the variety of pieces of information. These are broken into 16-bit portions, the message. Heather includes a 16-bit number corresponding to the query, the reply, to this query with and use that same number. So, you know, you're getting a response back, basically just labeling, right? Then applying the back where number if you will flags that could be said for options. Like whether whether the type of message is a query or reply, weather, recursion is De loud. Is desired or aloud whether reply is it from an authoritative Source or not?
 There'd be other fields, including the size of optional header elements that we want. Talk about in depth.
 So we're going to do next to try to understand a little bit more about how DNS works as well. Go through an interactive, look up using the Unix program called dig with us. Lets you do is that lets you query the DNS system,, and then it'll dump the field from the DNS responses. So, basically looking at these DNS protocol messages, so by default that would execute workers Aquarius, which you can disable. We have this option just to set that it's not recursive. So it's just going to operate one step at a time. So that's what we're going to do it through this quick demonstration of this. So let's suppose we want to look up the IP address for cnn.com, specifically www.cnn.com. And we're going to query, one of the root servers. The root servers are down. They're labeled a through M. And you can access them through this route Dash servers. Net domain name.
 So if you run this command you to get back some responses, some Header information. Of course. In this case, you're sending a query out. The question that you're looking for, is what is the a name? Basically? What's the IP address? Corresponding to cnn.com? It was no answer section yet. Then there's some Authority authoritative information, which is just representing the various.
 For this top-level domain,, where you could look up to figure out that answer. So, just going on within the same query, other would be additional information corresponding to what those top level with the top level domain name, server names would correspond to in IP addresses so I can see that's a this suck at the G1. The g. Gtld - service. Net the A&M record for that would correspond to this IP address. This one 92. 42. 93. 30 timing information for this in which server had replied. If we go back and look we ask ask the root server labeled a. That's the server that had replied.
 Brett. So after we figure it out. Okay, I can go look up at a what what this response means is it, I can go. Ask now this route server with the subdomain, a, how to get to cnn.com again. We didn't run this in the in the recursive mode.
 So now, if I ask one of the top level domain servers, how to get to cnn.com., I just pick one of them that had replied, what will see now. And in some of the responses for cnn.com, we could access that with this other domain name, for this TW, DNS. Text, your one. And ask that aol.com. So that be that the
 Domain name server for cnn.com then. There'd be some additional information and coding. What were the actual IP addresses corresponding to those hosts names for those two servers?
 Rats are moving along then. So we'll do one more query. If we now go query one of those particular domain name servers. We just picked one of them. Random arbitrarily out of the four that came back with the response and we ask it what the IP address for www.cnn.com has. That was the question that we ask that the NS server and we're asking at what is the IP address. Corresponding to that domain name, the response back that we get and the answer.
 From the DNS system is that www.cnn.com is a c name or an alias for cnn.com. And then any of these IP addresses should work if you want to access www.cnn.com. So if you typed in your web browser any of these addresses, they should all take you to cnn.com. So there could be more than one as you can see and this could be for various load-balancing reasons that we mentioned a little bit earlier having these geographically distributed so that perhaps we'll look up or accessing that website would be faster in a certain region of the world. You you might be directed to use a particular one of those servers based on that kind of criteria, right? But this is how we would have started manual. Gone through that process of getting what IP address correspondent to www.cnn.com.
 So that's a little bit of an overview of the DNS protocol, all the different types of resource record so I can eat AMC names and what some of the information would look like when the queries in the DNS system were actually occurring.
