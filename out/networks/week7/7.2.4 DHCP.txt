The next will discuss a little bit of the detail and how the DHCP protocol Works to dynamically assign IP addresses.
 So, the problem we're solving is, how do we get an IP address when we don't have one? So how would a host get one? So it could be hard-coated by a system, administrator their ways to do this. So you can manually set the IP of your computer in Windows eunuchs, and other operating systems. However, that's pretty brutal. If you put in the wrong value of things change. So, what's commonly used is called DHCP, which word dynamically find an IP address from a server.
 So the goal of the DHCP protocol is to allow the host to dynamically find an IP address from the network server when it joins the network. So we could renew this.
 When a lease expires, so essentially a time to live with how long that address is valid. You could then reuse, addresses support for mobile users, who want to join the network and then leave perhaps. So basically we're going to walk through how DHCP works. This is just a brief overview of it. The hosts could broadcast i d h c p v, c p server would respond with an offer message the hosted request, an IP address and the DHCP server would respond with an acknowledgement.
 So let's look at this kind of scenario. Let's suppose we have a network setup in this way. We have a few subnet setup. There's a DHCP server connected in one of the subnets and we have a laptop, joining the network and now it needs an IP address so that it can communicate with the local network as well as Beyonce on the internet. So the DHCP server, as he arrived in client gets connected. It realizes, it doesn't have an IP address. So it sends out a broadcast. Is there in a DHCP server available?
 It would have included some information within that discovery about what it may think. This Source address would be. So the source address of 0000. This would effectively be a broadcast type of address, likewise that destination address of 255, repeated is indicating a broadcast. So the DHCP server would receive that. It would interpreted and say, okay. I'm a DHCP server and it would send a message back and coated with its IP back to everyone. So I can I broadcast cuz it doesn't know how to address that client, because, that client doesn't have an IP address. So then the arrival client would say, okay. I'll take an IP address it again, does this through broadcast because it still doesn't have an IP address assigned yet. Then the DHCP server would respond back with an acknowledgement.
 Okay, you've got that particular IP address. And now it would have assigned an IP address, but this would have come through this broadcast from the DHCP server because they arrived in client up. Until this particular point in this time flow, didn't have an IP address assigned.
 So did she pee can do a bit more than just a signing IP addresses? It can return more than just that allocated address on the subnet. I typically would provide a Gateway names and addresses of a DNS server, as well as with the network mask would be so indicating the network versus the host portions of the IP address.
 So, let's look at another DHCP example. So let's suppose we connect this laptop at needs an IP address of the first top router. And often times up. Rogers said, your home network would have a DHCP server built in. So it would build up this request. It wouldn't capsule8. This say, starting a DHCP realize when you TP, so it would be that transport layer message than an encapsulated into an IP message using the broadcast address. Then sent down on the link layer is an Ethernet. If it's physically plugged in that ethernet frame would get broadcasted to everyone on the land sort of like how in the our protocol worked. This should get received by this router running the DHCP server, I would then get Dakota to its DHCP information. So that beatboxing process would strip off all that header.
 Information until it gets down to the relevant, DHCP information.
 The Deep the DHCP server within formulate, an acknowledgement containing the clients IP address, the IP address of the first top. Router, the note itself, the name and IP address of the DNS server. So then encapsulate that back down to the link layer, of course, and send it over to the MAC address corresponding to that particular note. So, the client would now I know it's IP address and the name and address of the DNS server as well as the first top Gateway, router IP address.
 Let's just look at a little bit of a log recorded from Wireshark. When a Homeland for this process. So, this would be the request from the client in. This would be the reply from the DNS server from the DHCP server. So initially the request, as we can see, maybe a little bit small, but the client IP address is, just assigned is all zeros.
 And but we do see the MAC address and coded for the client there.
 Right. So then the reply from the DHCP server would have the IP address and coated in it. Writes for the IP that's been assigned. The gateway address and some of these other components, like, DNS servers, that we've also discussed. So this is my sending out this broadcast information, getting this reply from a DHCP server. On the network. This is how this new no joining. The network would have been assigned. Its IP address.
