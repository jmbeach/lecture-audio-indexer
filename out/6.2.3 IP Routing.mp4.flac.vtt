00:00.300 --> 00:11.100
So now we're going to continue our discussion of how IP addressing works and part with how the prefixes that are used in defining routes and in constructing

00:11.100 --> 00:12.600
forwarding tables

00:13.900 --> 00:16.000
So the address host on the internet

00:16.000 --> 00:17.800
What is the internet again

00:17.800 --> 00:19.300
while it's a network of networks

00:19.300 --> 00:31.000
We need to be able to refer to particular hosts in this network as well as to router as well as to Route both routers and networks here

00:31.000 --> 00:31.700
All right

00:31.700 --> 00:33.300
so this would be say Network to

00:33.300 --> 00:38.300
This is Network one and we need to be able to get from any host year to any ghosts here

00:38.300 --> 00:39.400
So

00:39.400 --> 00:40.000
how can we do that

00:40.000 --> 00:43.500
We use the routers to move information

00:43.500 --> 00:45.700
over the router

00:45.700 --> 00:49.600
would consist of a set of input interfaces for the packet would come in

00:49.600 --> 00:51.000
But about put in their faces

00:51.000 --> 00:51.900
were they depart

00:51.900 --> 00:54.100
And then some form of interconnect as we've seen

00:54.100 --> 00:55.500
So

00:55.500 --> 01:00.800
the router would implement this boarding process to make sure we get to their correct output interface

01:00.800 --> 01:03.500
but how do we select the right

01:04.400 --> 01:05.700
I'll put in her face

01:05.700 --> 01:06.500
Well

01:06.500 --> 01:09.100
when part use the IP address to do that

01:09.100 --> 01:11.700
so the forwarding table within the router

01:11.700 --> 01:14.800
often denoted with this kind of

01:14.800 --> 01:16.700
annotations us

01:16.700 --> 01:21.100
a story mapping between IP addresses and output interfaces

01:21.100 --> 01:28.900
And then what the forwarding table will do is will forward an incoming packet based on its destination address

01:28.900 --> 01:30.100
So for example

01:30.100 --> 01:34.800
if this is a router directly connected to a few computers

01:34.800 --> 01:37.500
if it received a packet

01:37.500 --> 01:43.900
Dustin 4, 1235, it knows it's in that packet out to interface one

01:44.700 --> 01:46.500
So

01:46.500 --> 01:46.900
for example

01:46.900 --> 01:49.400
if it had this packet intended for one

01:49.400 --> 01:49.600
two

01:49.600 --> 01:49.800
three

01:49.800 --> 01:50.100
four

01:50.100 --> 01:56.700
which one do we need to send it through while we need to send it over out on interface to because that's how we'll get to that address

01:56.700 --> 02:05.400
So this whole routing this forwarding process for this table has been constructed by running a routing algorithm

02:05.400 --> 02:06.800
which we previously seen

02:06.800 --> 02:08.600
where has this other pack it again

02:08.600 --> 02:11.000
intended for 5 needs to get Rabbit out through

02:11.000 --> 02:13.500
Interface up an interface number one

02:15.100 --> 02:20.400
So there is a big scalability Challenge and which motivates why were using the prefix has

02:20.400 --> 02:21.900
So let's just suppose for a moment

02:21.900 --> 02:26.400
We're not doing it with prefixes and that hosts could have totally arbitrary addresses

02:26.400 --> 02:27.400
Well

02:27.400 --> 02:28.000
if we did this

02:28.000 --> 02:33.300
now hosts would rather the routers would need to have a lot of information

02:33.300 --> 02:39.800
It would need to know how to forward packets directly to where the any particular host ride

02:39.800 --> 02:41.400
So if I didn't stay organized

02:41.400 --> 02:42.200
this network

02:42.200 --> 02:44.700
consisting only of prefixes 123

02:44.700 --> 02:49.400
If I let there be IP addresses and this network 1 b

02:49.400 --> 02:54.800
1 2 3 4, maybe 5 6, 7 8, and then likewise over in the second Network

02:54.800 --> 02:56.600
We allowed addresses

02:56.600 --> 03:02.900
like 1, 2, 3, 5, and 5 6, 7 9, we would need to remember all of that information in the routers

03:02.900 --> 03:08.300
So at the forwarding tables would look like safe for really any of these routers here

03:08.300 --> 03:15.100
If it received a message intended for 1, 2 3 4, it would need it to remember that it needs to four

03:15.100 --> 03:16.100
Distraction

03:16.100 --> 03:20.000
if it received a message for 1235, it would need to remember

03:20.000 --> 03:21.600
it needs to forward it towards the

03:21.600 --> 03:21.800
right

03:21.800 --> 03:23.300
So we don't do that

03:23.300 --> 03:34.300
And the reason we don't as we will use the prefix has to avoid having to remember all that information will have put related hosts

03:34.300 --> 03:37.900
Are you those in one of the networks on a common subnet

03:37.900 --> 03:38.700
So

03:38.700 --> 03:39.000
for example

03:39.000 --> 03:40.900
all of the horse over here

03:40.900 --> 03:42.300
we would have signed with addresses

03:42.300 --> 03:42.700
like one

03:42.700 --> 03:42.900
two

03:42.900 --> 03:43.000
three

03:43.000 --> 03:46.400
starting and all the hosts over here

03:46.400 --> 03:50.700
We would require them to start with the prefix 567 that way

03:50.700 --> 03:56.700
if we get any message intended for a host starting with the prefix 123

03:56.700 --> 03:59.400
We know we send that information to the left

03:59.400 --> 04:09.300
And if we receive any message intended for an IP address starting with 5 6 7, then we send it over to the right

04:10.100 --> 04:14.200
The other benefit of this is it's very easy to add new hosts

04:14.200 --> 04:17.200
Even if I add a new computer in to this network

04:17.200 --> 04:24.300
to I give it a IP IP address that's reasonably defined as a 5 6 7

04:24.300 --> 04:25.100
And then some number

04:25.100 --> 04:28.500
I don't even need to update any information at these routers

04:28.500 --> 04:29.100
right

04:29.100 --> 04:33.100
I don't I don't need to update any of the routing information here

04:33.100 --> 04:43.500
All I need to do is updated for the strictly connected router that's sending that information to that particular host that's been added to the network

04:43.500 --> 04:44.300
So

04:44.300 --> 04:49.300
this decomposition into this hierarchy is what I'll allow us in part to scale up

04:50.700 --> 04:57.100
The IP addressing mechanisms and enable easy routing and it's just an alligator stew

04:57.100 --> 04:57.400
Things

04:57.400 --> 05:01.500
You're already familiar with in your day-to-day life such as postal mail

05:01.500 --> 05:07.300
This is why I come and geographic regions would use the same or similar postal code

05:07.300 --> 05:08.000
right

05:08.000 --> 05:14.900
Like that Vanderbilt the ZIP code that gets used for my office

05:14.900 --> 05:18.500
Has 37 212 and I live fairly close to Vanderbilt

05:18.500 --> 05:22.500
My home zip code is 37214

05:22.500 --> 05:23.900
And as you can see

05:23.900 --> 05:26.700
they both start with 372

05:26.700 --> 05:28.700
And that's a reason

05:28.700 --> 05:35.600
the reason for that is exactly the same reason of why IP addresses are using these common prefixes

05:35.600 --> 05:37.300
It was a totally arbitrary number

05:37.300 --> 05:41.700
It wouldn't make any sense in terms of helping us a group that

05:41.700 --> 05:43.100
destinations together
