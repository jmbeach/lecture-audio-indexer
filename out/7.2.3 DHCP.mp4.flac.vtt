00:00.600 --> 00:03.900
So next we'll discuss the address resolution protocol

00:03.900 --> 00:09.600
which is used to come up with a mapping between Mac addresses and IP addresses

00:09.600 --> 00:15.500
So let's first give a little bit of an overview of how the process works

00:15.500 --> 00:19.000
So we're call that we have 32-bit IP addresses

00:19.000 --> 00:21.400
This is used for Network layer Services

00:21.400 --> 00:21.800
right

00:21.800 --> 00:27.800
So for IP type of services for doing a forwarding of information through the network

00:27.800 --> 00:31.300
the MAC address or land

00:31.300 --> 00:35.400
physical or ethernet address would be some other common terms for this

00:35.400 --> 00:49.000
This would be used locally to get access to an interface and send it out in her that information that's necessary to be sent to another interface in the same network

00:49.000 --> 00:56.800
So very low-level sort of Link layer type of an address

00:56.800 --> 00:58.200
So we'll see some more details

00:58.200 --> 01:00.400
So the 48 bit

01:00.600 --> 01:04.900
Mac address is put into the network interface cards

01:04.900 --> 01:05.500
read-only memory

01:05.500 --> 01:08.100
but sometimes it software setup

01:08.100 --> 01:08.200
Oh

01:08.200 --> 01:11.900
so you may know how to change the sand in a higher-level operating system

01:11.900 --> 01:14.700
So what

01:14.700 --> 01:18.100
what would this look like with these lanter Mac address is

01:18.100 --> 01:26.400
So every computer on the network would be associated with a Mac address

01:26.400 --> 01:27.100
right

01:27.100 --> 01:28.200
Every interface card

01:28.200 --> 01:31.800
And then if we want to send information between hosts

01:31.800 --> 01:34.300
we use this Mac address

01:34.300 --> 01:37.100
This is what the adapters actually understand

01:37.100 --> 01:38.700
They don't understand IP addresses

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
how Mac addresses are assigned or allocated is administered by a Trip Lee

01:47.000 --> 01:52.900
When someone wants to produce network interface cards

01:52.900 --> 01:57.200
they buy a portion of the MAC address space to try to ensure uniqueness

01:57.200 --> 01:57.900
although occasionally

01:57.900 --> 02:04.000
there can be duplicate Mac addresses and it can cause all sorts of interesting Network problem

02:04.000 --> 02:05.800
But analogously

02:05.800 --> 02:08.000
you can think of the MAC address for the Vodka

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
social security number and IP address

02:10.000 --> 02:11.600
sort of like a postal address

02:11.600 --> 02:13.900
The Mac addresses are flat

02:13.900 --> 02:17.800
which enables portability so you can move between different networks

02:17.800 --> 02:23.700
Whereas the IP address space was hierarchical and it's not really portable

02:23.700 --> 02:26.400
It depends on what IP subnet

02:26.400 --> 02:27.900
The note is attached to

02:29.300 --> 02:32.600
So what's the address resolution protocol dies

02:32.600 --> 02:37.900
His that would determine and interfaces Mac address knowing its IP address

02:37.900 --> 02:38.700
or at

02:38.700 --> 02:39.600
So this is basically

02:39.600 --> 02:41.800
I would operate

02:41.800 --> 02:43.500
So I have all these hosts

02:43.500 --> 02:45.000
They have IP addresses

02:45.000 --> 02:48.800
and Mac addresses assigned to them

02:48.800 --> 02:52.600
So this is done through the usage of a table called the ARP table

02:52.600 --> 02:53.800
For this each

02:53.800 --> 02:55.300
i p notes are hosta

02:55.300 --> 02:56.300
Router on the land

02:56.300 --> 03:01.100
with the network would have this table and this would only be the local network

03:01.100 --> 03:01.400
Right

03:01.400 --> 03:03.100
So we don't do this over the Internet

03:03.100 --> 03:05.700
the IP and Mac address

03:05.700 --> 03:11.000
Mappings for some landlords would basically appear like IP address

03:11.000 --> 03:13.100
Mac address and a time to live

03:13.100 --> 03:17.600
So this would be the time after which the address is mapping

03:17.600 --> 03:18.500
would get forgotten

03:18.500 --> 03:19.500
typically

03:19.500 --> 03:20.800
set to about 20 minutes

03:21.800 --> 03:28.500
So let's go over some of the usage of the our protocol on the same land

03:28.500 --> 03:32.100
So suppose a wants to send information to be bees

03:32.100 --> 03:34.400
Mac address is not an Aesop Fable

03:34.400 --> 03:41.600
So what would occur is a wood broadcast and art querry packet containing bees IP address

03:41.600 --> 03:44.800
It would send it out to the broadcast Mac address

03:44.800 --> 03:46.700
which is all at all

03:46.700 --> 03:48.900
The notes on the land would receive that query

03:48.900 --> 03:53.700
Be would receive that are packaged as well and it would reply to a with it

03:53.700 --> 03:55.700
Maybe is Mac address

03:55.700 --> 04:01.300
So that would be sent to a smack address because a head attached

04:01.300 --> 04:03.700
It's Mac address in that broadcast query

04:03.700 --> 04:06.800
he would then cash the IP to MAC address

04:06.800 --> 04:10.900
Parents are table until that information expired or became hold

04:11.600 --> 04:12.400
So

04:12.400 --> 04:13.500
our biggest plug-and-play

04:13.500 --> 04:20.000
so the nodes do create their own ARP tables without intervention from the network administrator

04:21.400 --> 04:23.700
So let's walk through an example of how this would work

04:23.700 --> 04:37.600
So let's suppose we want to send the information from A to B through router are and where to focus on all the addressing aspects are both the IP addressing in the Mac addressing portions

04:37.600 --> 04:40.000
So let's assume that a nose

04:40.000 --> 04:41.600
B's IP address already

04:41.600 --> 04:45.800
Let's also assume that a nosey IP address of the first router

04:45.800 --> 04:49.200
I wish you could have been determined say with DHCP is

04:49.200 --> 04:51.800
So may also knows ours Mac address

04:51.800 --> 04:57.400
which it could have already discovered through that are process that we just discussed

04:58.600 --> 04:59.200
So

04:59.200 --> 05:08.700
what would happen as a would create a message or an IP datagram with its source a and its destination be using those IP addresses

05:08.700 --> 05:11.600
So we have the IP address for a source IP address

05:11.600 --> 05:14.900
The IP address for B is the destination IP address

05:16.400 --> 05:21.800
Then what would happen if it would create a link layer frame with ours Mac address

05:21.800 --> 05:22.600
That's the router

05:22.600 --> 05:32.900
we need to route through as the destination address and then the frame would contain the ETA to be IP layer message

05:32.900 --> 05:33.500
right

05:33.500 --> 05:34.000
So

05:34.000 --> 05:38.500
what we can see here is the source Mac address has been set to a smack address

05:38.500 --> 05:44.700
The destination Mac address has been set to the incoming length of router are right

05:44.700 --> 05:46.900
So we can see the C6 starting here

05:48.400 --> 05:51.700
So that frame would get sent from a two

05:51.700 --> 05:54.600
are over this low-level lower layer protocol

05:54.600 --> 05:55.200
the link

05:56.200 --> 06:04.500
Lincoln Physical layer protocols when when that's received by the router

06:04.500 --> 06:08.600
it would remove the data

06:08.600 --> 06:08.900
Graham

06:08.900 --> 06:14.800
It would see that the information was intended for it because it's destination Mac address had been set to it

06:14.800 --> 06:18.600
Then it would pass this information up to the hype helaire

06:18.600 --> 06:23.200
We'd see the destination address is 22, repeated

06:23.200 --> 06:28.000
We know that needs to be routed out through this outgoing link after we've constructed

06:28.000 --> 06:30.900
a routing table are within forward

06:30.900 --> 06:31.900
the state of Graham

06:31.900 --> 06:38.300
This message with the IP source as A's are at so

06:38.300 --> 06:43.700
leaving by PMS which basically the same and leaving the destination is BS

06:43.700 --> 06:44.500
IP address

06:45.600 --> 06:47.200
Are wood

06:47.200 --> 06:49.300
then a prefix in front of that

06:49.300 --> 06:52.200
The link layer Freeman formation with bees Mac addresses

06:52.200 --> 06:53.200
the destination address

06:53.200 --> 06:57.500
So that the Springwood now contain the 8 to be datagram

06:57.500 --> 07:03.100
So we can see is that the source address is this incoming

07:03.100 --> 07:13.600
from the perspective of be its this interface on the routers Mac address and the destination Mac address is the MAC address of be rats in this way

07:13.600 --> 07:23.700
The information could get sent over to be from a and the addressing all the way down to the link layer would have been accommodated be with and strip off the link later

07:23.700 --> 07:27.700
Had her information and pull out the IP layer information

07:28.600 --> 07:30.000
So that summarizes

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
the way that our quirks

07:32.000 --> 07:32.600
And again

07:32.600 --> 07:38.100
what this would do is come up with the mapping between IP addresses and Mac address pierce

07:38.100 --> 07:41.100
It does this in the ARP table in a packet

07:41.100 --> 07:41.900
needs to be sent

07:41.900 --> 07:49.600
It would consult the ARP table so that it could look up the actual Mac address of the destination and then

07:49.600 --> 07:50.500
it wouldn't capsulated

07:50.500 --> 07:50.800
So

07:50.800 --> 07:51.400
this again

07:51.400 --> 07:54.700
just would be put in front of the packet

07:54.700 --> 07:55.700
header of the IP Hider

07:55.700 --> 07:56.100
say

07:56.100 --> 07:58.100
for the link layer header

07:58.100 --> 08:02.300
So if we didn't have the IP address on the table

08:02.300 --> 08:05.800
I will Whitaker is the sender would request you

08:05.800 --> 08:07.000
How's that IP address

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
The receiver would respond back and then this Underwood cash that result

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
So they're more details for this link layer protocol

08:14.000 --> 08:20.100
but its necessary to be able to connect things up and do bootstrap

08:20.100 --> 08:21.400
the IP connectivity
