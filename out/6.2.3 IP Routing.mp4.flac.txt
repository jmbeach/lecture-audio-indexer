So now we're going to continue our discussion of how IP addressing works and part with how the prefixes that are used in defining routes and in constructing, forwarding tables.
 So the address host on the internet. What is the internet again, while it's a network of networks? We need to be able to refer to particular hosts in this network as well as to router as well as to Route both routers and networks here. All right, so this would be say Network to. This is Network one and we need to be able to get from any host year to any ghosts here. So, how can we do that? We use the routers to move information, over the router, would consist of a set of input interfaces for the packet would come in. But about put in their faces, were they depart? And then some form of interconnect as we've seen. So, the router would implement this boarding process to make sure we get to their correct output interface, but how do we select the right?
 I'll put in her face. Well, when part use the IP address to do that, so the forwarding table within the router, often denoted with this kind of, annotations us, a story mapping between IP addresses and output interfaces. And then what the forwarding table will do is will forward an incoming packet based on its destination address. So for example, if this is a router directly connected to a few computers, if it received a packet, Dustin 4, 1235, it knows it's in that packet out to interface one.
 So, for example, if it had this packet intended for one, two, three, four, which one do we need to send it through while we need to send it over out on interface to because that's how we'll get to that address. So this whole routing this forwarding process for this table has been constructed by running a routing algorithm, which we previously seen, where has this other pack it again, intended for 5 needs to get Rabbit out through. Interface up an interface number one.
 So there is a big scalability Challenge and which motivates why were using the prefix has. So let's just suppose for a moment. We're not doing it with prefixes and that hosts could have totally arbitrary addresses. Well, if we did this, now hosts would rather the routers would need to have a lot of information. It would need to know how to forward packets directly to where the any particular host ride. So if I didn't stay organized, this network, consisting only of prefixes 123. If I let there be IP addresses and this network 1 b. 1 2 3 4, maybe 5 6, 7 8, and then likewise over in the second Network. We allowed addresses, like 1, 2, 3, 5, and 5 6, 7 9, we would need to remember all of that information in the routers. So at the forwarding tables would look like safe for really any of these routers here. If it received a message intended for 1, 2 3 4, it would need it to remember that it needs to four.
 Distraction, if it received a message for 1235, it would need to remember, it needs to forward it towards the, right. So we don't do that. And the reason we don't as we will use the prefix has to avoid having to remember all that information will have put related hosts. Are you those in one of the networks on a common subnet? So, for example, all of the horse over here, we would have signed with addresses, like one, two, three, starting and all the hosts over here. We would require them to start with the prefix 567 that way, if we get any message intended for a host starting with the prefix 123. We know we send that information to the left. And if we receive any message intended for an IP address starting with 5 6 7, then we send it over to the right.
 The other benefit of this is it's very easy to add new hosts. Even if I add a new computer in to this network, to I give it a IP IP address that's reasonably defined as a 5 6 7. And then some number, I don't even need to update any information at these routers, right? I don't I don't need to update any of the routing information here. All I need to do is updated for the strictly connected router that's sending that information to that particular host that's been added to the network. So, this decomposition into this hierarchy is what I'll allow us in part to scale up.
 The IP addressing mechanisms and enable easy routing and it's just an alligator stew. Things. You're already familiar with in your day-to-day life such as postal mail. This is why I come and geographic regions would use the same or similar postal code, right? Like that Vanderbilt the ZIP code that gets used for my office. Has 37 212 and I live fairly close to Vanderbilt. My home zip code is 37214. And as you can see, they both start with 372. And that's a reason, the reason for that is exactly the same reason of why IP addresses are using these common prefixes. It was a totally arbitrary number. It wouldn't make any sense in terms of helping us a group that, destinations together.
